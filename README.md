## Description

This repository provides a PyTorch wrapper around a CUDA kernel that implements
the method described in [Maximizing parallelism in the construction of BVHs,
octrees, and k-d trees](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2383801). More
specifically, given an input mesh it builds a
BVH tree for each one and queries it for self-intersections. Moreover, we
provide a conical 3D distance field based loss for resolving the interpenetrations, as in [Capturing Hands in Action using Discriminative Salient Points and Physics Simulation](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-016-0895-4).

Please note that in the current implementation, for batching one needs to provide meshes with the *same* number of faces. Moreover, the code by default works for self-penetrations of a body mesh. The module can be used also for inter-penetrations of different meshes - for this the easiest and naive approach (without additional bookkeeping) is to fuse all meshes in a single mesh and treat inter-penetrations as self-penetrations.


## Installation

Before installing anything please make sure to set the environment variable
*$CUDA_SAMPLES_INC* to the path that contains the header `helper_math.h`, which
can be found in the repo [CUDA Samples repository](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-samples).
To install the module run the following commands:  

**1. Clone this repository**
```Shell
git clone https://github.com/vchoutas/torch-mesh-isect
cd torch-mesh-isect
```
**2. Install the dependencies**
```Shell
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```
**3. Run the *setup.py* script**
```Shell
python setup.py install
```

## Examples

* [Collision Detection](./examples/detect_and_plot_collisions.py): Given an
  input mesh file, detect and plot all the collisions. Use:
  ```Shell
  python examples/detect_and_plot_collisions.py PATH_TO_MESH
  ```
* [Batch Collision resolution](./examples/batch_smpl_untangle.py):  Resolve self-penetrations for a batch of body models. To run use:
  ```Shell
  WEIGHT=0.001
  python examples/batch_smpl_untangle.py --coll_loss_weight=$WEIGHT --model_folder=$MODEL_PARENT_FOLDER --part_segm_fn=$PATH_part_segm_fn 
  --param_fn PKL_FN1 PKL_FN2 ... PKL_FNN  
  ```
  where `PKL_FN*` are the filenames of the .pkl files that [can be downloaded here](https://owncloud.tuebingen.mpg.de/index.php/s/bEKMdqf5WbN4MnH) and contain the parameters for each body model. 
  
  For `batch_smpl_untangle`:  
  - To download the SMPL body model  please see the directions for [downloding](https://github.com/vchoutas/smplx/blob/master/README.md#downloading-the-model) and for specific [placing in folder structure and renaming](https://github.com/vchoutas/smplx/blob/master/README.md#model-loading).
  - The file for the `part_segm_fn` argument for SMPL can be downloaded [here](https://owncloud.tuebingen.mpg.de/index.php/s/jHdgwkREzS43rjN).
